                <br />Dear Basketball,
          <br />From the moment
          <br /> I started rolling my dad’s tube socks
          <br /> And shooting imaginary
          <br />Game-winning shots
          <br />In the Great Western Forum
          <br /> I knew one thing was real:
          <br />
          <br /> I fell in love with you.
          <br />A love so deep I gave you my all —
          <br /> From my mind & body
          <br /> To my spirit & soul.
          <br />
          <br />As a six-year-old boy
          <br /> Deeply in love with you
          <br /> I never saw the end of the tunnel.
          <br /> I only saw myself
          <br /> Running out of one.
          <br />
          <br />And so I ran.
          <br /> I ran up and down every court
          <br /> After every loose ball for you.
          <br /> You asked for my hustle
          <br /> I gave you my heart
          <br /> Because it came with so much more.
          <br />
          <br />I played through the sweat and hurt
          <br /> Not because challenge called me
          <br /> But because YOU called me.
          <br /> I did everything for YOU
          <br /> Because that’s what you do
          <br /> When someone makes you feel as
          <br /> Alive as you’ve made me feel.
          <br />You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream
          <br /> And I’ll always love you for it.
          <br /> But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer.
          <br /> This season is all I have left to give.
          <br /> My heart can take the pounding
          <br /> My mind can handle the grind
          <br /> But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye.
          <br />
          <br />And that’s OK.
          <br /> I’m ready to let you go.
          <br /> I want you to know now
          <br /> So we both can savor every moment we have left together.
          <br /> The good and the bad.
          <br /> We have given each other
          <br /> All that we have.
          <br />
          <br />And we both know, no matter what I do next
          <br /> I’ll always be that kid
          <br /> With the rolled up socks
          <br /> Garbage can in the corner
          <br /> :05 seconds on the clock
          <br /> Ball in my hands.
          <br /> 5 … 4 … 3 … 2 … 1
          <br />Love you always,
          <br />Kobe
