                            <h1>Early life and Education</h1>
                            <h3>Lower Merion High School</h3>
                            <p>Bryant earned national recognition during a spectacular high school career
                              at Lower Merion High School located in Ardmore, in the Philadelphia suburb
                              of Lower Merion. As a freshman, he played for the varsity basketball team.[12]
                              He became the first freshman in decades to start for Lower Merion's varsity
                              team, but the team finished with a 4–20 record.[12][13] The following three
                              years, the Aces compiled a 77–13 record, with Bryant playing all five positions.[12]
                              During his junior year, he averaged 31.1 points, 10.4 rebounds and 5.2
                              assists and was named Pennsylvania Player of the Year,[14] attracting attention
                              from college recruiters in the process.[14] Duke, North Carolina, Villanova
                              and Michigan were at the top of his list; however, when Kevin Garnett went
                              in the first round of the 1995 NBA Draft, he began considering going directly
                              to the pros.[14] At Adidas ABCD camp, Bryant earned the 1995 senior MVP
                              award,[15] while playing alongside future NBA teammate Lamar Odom.[16]
                              While in high school, then 76ers coach John Lucas invited Bryant to work
                              out and scrimmage with the team, where he played one-on-one with Jerry
                              Stackhouse.[17] In his senior year of high school, Bryant led the Aces
                              to their first state championship in 53 years. During the run, he averaged
                              30.8 points, 12 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 4.0 steals, and 3.8 blocked shots
                              in leading the Aces to a 31–3 record.[18] Bryant ended his high school
                              career as Southeastern Pennsylvania's all-time leading scorer at 2,883
                              points, surpassing both Wilt Chamberlain and Lionel Simmons.[19] Bryant
                              received several awards for his performance his senior year including being
                              named Naismith High School Player of the Year, Gatorade Men's National
                              Basketball Player of the Year, a McDonald's All-American, and a USA Today
                              All-USA First Team player.[20] Bryant's varsity coach, Greg Downer, commented
                              that he was "a complete player who dominates" and praised his work ethic,
                              even as the team's top player.[18][21] In 1996, Bryant took R&amp;B singer
                              Brandy to his senior prom,[22] though the two were, and remain, just friends.
                              Ultimately, however, the 17-year-old Bryant made the decision to go directly
                              into the NBA, only the sixth player in NBA history to do so.[12] Bryant's
                              news was met with a lot of publicity at a time when prep-to-pro NBA players
                              were not very common (Garnett being the only exception in 20 years).[12]
                              His basketball skills and SAT score of 1080 would have ensured admission
                              to any college he chose,[23] but he did not officially visit any campuses.[21]
                              In 2012, Bryant was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald's All-Americans.[24]</p>
