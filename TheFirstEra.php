                        <h1>1996 Draft</h1>
                        <p>The first guard to ever be taken out of high school, Bryant was chosen
                            as the 13th overall draft pick by the Charlotte Hornets in 1996.[25] According
                            to Arn Tellem, Bryant's agent at the time, Bryant playing for the Charlotte
                            Hornets was "an impossibility."[26] However, Bill Branch, the Hornets'
                            head scout at the time, said that the Hornets agreed to trade their draft
                            selection to the Lakers before picking Bryant. The teams agreed to the
                            trade the day before the draft and the Lakers told the Hornets whom to
                            select five minutes before the pick was made.[27] Branch said that prior
                            to the trade agreement, the Hornets never even considered drafting Bryant.
                            Prior to the draft, Bryant had worked out in Los Angeles, where he scrimmaged
                            against former Lakers players Larry Drew and Michael Cooper, and according
                            to then-Laker manager Jerry West, "marched over these people."[28] On July
                            1, 1996, West traded his starting center, Vlade Divac, to the Hornets in
                            exchange for Bryant's draft rights.[29] Since he was still 17 at the time
                            of the draft, his parents had to cosign his contract with the Lakers until
                            he was able to sign his own when he turned 18 before the season began.[30]</p>

                                        <h3>Los Angeles Lakers 1996-1999</h3>
                                        <p>Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring
                                            25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders struggled to
                                            get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach
                                            Del Harris. He scored 36 points in the finale, and finished with averages
                                            of 24.5 points and 5.3 rebounds in four game.[31][32] As a rookie in 1996–97,
                                            Bryant mostly came off the bench behind guards Eddie Jones and Nick Van
                                            Exel.[33] At the time he became the youngest player ever to play in an
                                            NBA game (18 years, 72 days; a record since broken by Jermaine O'Neal and
                                            former teammate Andrew Bynum), and also became the youngest NBA starter
                                            ever (18 years, 158 days).[34][35] Initially, Bryant played limited minutes,
                                            but as the season continued, he began to see some more playing time. By
                                            the end of the season, he averaged 15.5 minutes a game. During the All-Star
                                            weekend, Bryant participated in the Rookie Challenge and won the 1997 Slam
                                            Dunk Contest, becoming the youngest dunk champion ever at the age of 18.[36]
                                            Bryant's performance throughout the year earned him a spot on the NBA All
                                            Rookie second team with fellow bench teammate Travis Knight.[37] The Lakers
                                            advanced to the Western Conference semifinals in the playoffs against the
                                            Utah Jazz, when Bryant was pressed into a lead role at the end of Game
                                            5. Byron Scott missed the game with a sprained wrist, Robert Horry was
                                            ejected for fighting with the Utah's Jeff Hornacek, and Shaquille O'Neal
                                            fouled out with 1:46 remaining in the fourth quarter. Bryant shot four
                                            air balls, and the Jazz won 98–93 in overtime to eliminate the Lakers 4–1.
                                            He first air-balled a jump shot to win the game in the fourth quarter,
                                            and misfired on three more in overtime, including two three-point field
                                            goals to tie the game in the final minute.[38] O'Neal commented that "[Bryant]
                                            was the only guy who had the guts at the time to take shots like that."[39]
                                            In Bryant's second season, he received more playing time and began to show
                                            more of his abilities as a talented young guard. As a result, Bryant's
                                            point averages more than doubled from 7.6 to 15.4 points per game.[40]
                                            Bryant would see an increase in minutes when the Lakers "played small",
                                            which would feature Bryant playing small forward alongside the guards he
                                            would usually back up.[41] Bryant was the runner-up for the NBA's Sixth
                                            Man of the Year Award,[42] and through fan voting, he also became the youngest
                                            NBA All-Star starter in NBA history.[43] He was joined by teammates O'Neal,
                                            Van Exel, and Jones, making it the first time since 1983 that four players
                                            on the same team were selected to play in the same All-Star Game. Bryant's
                                            15.4 points per game was the highest of any non-starter in the season.[44]
                                            The 1998–99 season marked Bryant's emergence as a premier guard in the
                                            league. With starting guards Van Exel and Jones traded, Bryant started
                                            every game for the lockout-shortened 50-game season. During the season,
                                            Bryant signed a 6-year contract extension worth $70 million.[44] This kept
                                            him with the Lakers until the end of the 2003–04 season. Even at an early
                                            stage of his career, sportswriters were comparing his skills to those of
                                            Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson.[30][45][46] The playoff results, however,
                                            were no better, as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the
                                            Western Conference Semifinals.[47]</p>

                                        <p>Bryant's fortunes would soon change when Phil Jackson became coach for
                                            the Los Angeles Lakers in 1999. After years of steady improvement, Bryant
                                            became one of the premier shooting guards in the league, earning appearances
                                            in the league's All-NBA,All-Star, and All-Defensive teams. The Los Angeles
                                            Lakers became true championship contenders under Bryant and O'Neal, who
                                            formed a legendary center-guard combination. Jackson utilized the triangle
                                            offense he used to win six championships with the Chicago Bulls, which
                                            would help both Bryant and O'Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>The three resulting championships won consecutively in 2000, 2001, and
                            2002 further proved such a fact. Bryant started the 1999–2000 season sidelined
                            for six weeks due to an injury to his hand suffered during a preseason
                            game against the Washington Wizards. With Bryant back and playing over
                            38 minutes a game, he saw an increase in all statistical categories in
                            the 1999–2000 season. This included leading the team in assists per game
                            and steals per game. The duo of O'Neal and Bryant backed with a strong
                            bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games, tied for fifth-most in NBA history.
                            This followed with O'Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the
                            All-NBA Team Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time
                            in his career (the youngest player ever to receive defensive honors). While
                            playing second fiddle to O'Neal in the playoffs, Bryant had some clutch
                            performances including a 25-point, 11 rebound, 7 assist, 4 block game in
                            game 7 of the Western Conference finals against the Portland Trail Blazers.[54]
                            He also threw an alley-oop pass to O'Neal to clinch the game and the series.
                            In the 2000 NBA Finals against the Indiana Pacers, Bryant injured his ankle
                            in the second quarter of Game 2 after landing on the Pacers' Jalen Rose's
                            foot. Rose later admitted he placed his foot under Bryant intentionally.
                            Bryant did not return to the game, and he also missed Game 3 due to the
